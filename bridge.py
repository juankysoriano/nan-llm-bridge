NaN LLM Bridge — a local HTTP proxy that adds resilience between
OpenAI-compatible clients (opencode, hermes, OpenAI Agents SDK, custom
integrations) and OpenAI-compatible upstreams (NaN Builders, LiteLLM
proxy, vLLM, llama.cpp, Together, Fireworks, Groq, etc.).

What "resilience" means concretely:

* Per-client **profiles** select which transformations apply. Same proxy,
  different paths, different behavior.

* **Retry policy** for transient upstream failures (5xx, 429, network
  errors) with exponential backoff. Configurable per profile.

* **Recovery** for the empty-content failure modes that plague
  thinking-mode models without `--reasoning-parser`: detects the
  thinking-overflow pattern, runs a two-tier `continue_final_message`
  fallback per Qwen's official guidance, and stitches the recovered
  answer back into the original response shape.

* **Rate limiting** per upstream — token bucket for RPM and a semaphore
  for max concurrent requests. Queues, doesn't reject. Different upstreams
  can have different limits.

* **Operational fixes** that bite any proxy chain talking to
  Cloudflare-fronted upstreams (gzip mismatch → forced
  `Accept-Encoding: identity`).

* **Live observability**: `/usage/stream` SSE feed for token counters,
  recent-request history, dashboard at `/` for at-a-glance status.

Endpoints:
  GET  /                        HTML dashboard (status + activity)
  GET  /health                  liveness check
  GET  /usage/stream            SSE feed of per-completion usage
  GET  /activity/stream         SSE feed of recent request metadata
  POST /{profile}/v1/responses  profile-routed Responses-API
  POST /{profile}/v1/chat/completions   profile-routed chat-completions
  *    /{profile}/v1/{path}     profile-routed catch-all (embeddings, audio…)
  *    /v1/{path}               default-profile catch-all (backward compat)

Configuration:
  See `BRIDGE_CONFIG_PATH` env var (defaults to
  ~/.config/resilient-llm-bridge/config.yaml).
  If the file is absent, sensible defaults are used (NaN Builders as the
  upstream, profiles for myproject / default).

    Why 3.0 instead of the textbook 3.5: tool results in agent
    workloads are dominated by JSON, code, log dumps, and other
    structurally-dense content, which tokenizes at ~2.5–3.0 chars per
    token (every `{`, `,`, `:` is its own token; short keys like `id`

    prose; under-counting on a JSON-heavy prompt drops us below the
    real input size and the cap-clamp lets the request through into
    a 400 ContextWindowExceeded — which some clients (e.g. opencode)
    don't recognise as overflow and silently hang on.

    Over-counting is cheap (slightly tighter `max_tokens` cap);
